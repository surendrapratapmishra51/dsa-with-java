# üìö Java DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Java DSA Practice Repository!  
This project contains a comprehensive collection of **Java programs**,
focused on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, 
solved and organized topic-wise using **IntelliJ IDEA**.

This repository reflects my continuous learning and preparation for technical placements.
